# Kaiju Tower Defense 🎮

A Python-based tower defense game featuring giant monsters (kaiju) and strategic defense mechanics. Built with Pygame, this project demonstrates object-oriented programming, game development, and real-time system design.

## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Combat System**: Multiple tower types with unique abilities and attack patterns
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Various enemy types with different behaviors and abilities
- **Boss Battles**: Special boss waves featuring powerful kaiju
- **Resource Management**: Economy system for tower placement and upgrades
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean interface with informative HUD and tooltips
- **Audio Integration**: Background music and sound effects for immersive gameplay

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Event System**: Robust event handling for game state management
- **Collision Detection**: Efficient implementation of hitbox and projectile systems
- **Path Finding**: Enemy movement system with predefined paths
- **Resource Management**: Memory-efficient asset loading and management
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering and update cycles
